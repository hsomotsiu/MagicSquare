# MagicSquare
A a program that will read in numbers from a text file and detect if those numbers are a “magic square” (a reference link is at the end of the document).
   The program detects that a 2D array of integers is a magic square, then the program should output the list of numbers, the order of the magic square, and the magic constant. If it's NOT a magic square, then the program should print: “The combination of numbers **list the numbers** is not a magic square.”
